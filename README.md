# Facial Expression Recognition

# Project Overview:
This project classifies human facial expressions into categories such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, **Neutral**, and more, using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The model is trained on a labeled facial image dataset and deployed with an interactive interface.
